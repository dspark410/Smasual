We all need a companion right? So why not explore some of our amazing personalities that is just a click of a button away.

USER JOURNEY 
AS A person interested in casual sex
I WANT TO find dates who are also interested in casual sex
SO THAT we can have casual sex with no expectations


GIVEN a user finds a date interesting
WHEN they choose to “hook up” with the date
THEN the date should receive an invitation email


BUSINESS CONTEXT For many adults, trying to figure out if a person is right for them can sometimes be quite a task, it takes too much time, planning, and even research, hence it becomes inefficient, right there and then life feels like a real pain. With the adoption of Smasual, one can quickly locate a suiteable person that fits their criteria and instantly hook up with no strings attached, thereafter continuing with there busy life feeling amazed after connecting for a short but memorable period of time.
